# Glucose-Lowering Medication Use for Diabetes: National Evidence from 62 Low- and Middle-Income Countries

This repository contains replication code for Teufel, Felix et al. "Glucose-Lowering Medication Use for Diabetes: National Evidence from 62 Low- and Middle-Income Countries", which is currently under review at Nature Communications. 

## System requirements

This code has been written in Stata SE version 15.1 for macOS Ventura 13.0.1 and not tested in other software versions or operating systems. The code does not require any non-standard hardware.

## Content

The following do-files can be found in the 'code' folder of this repository:
- XXX: XXX
- XXX: XXX
  
## Installation, demo and instructions

No software beyond Stata needs to be installed for running the code. The code can be run on a small simulated dataset that is provided in the 'data' folder of this repository. The generated output will show similar graphs as in the paper, though estimates will likely differ in the simulated dataset. The expected run time of all do-files on a desktop computer with 16GB RAM is around XX-XX minutes.
